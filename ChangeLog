Version 4.3 - June 09 2025

This is a quick maintenance release to fix an issue introduced in latest
release.

  - Drop extension before running tests on search_path.
  - Fix invalid search_path error. When pgtt isn't preloaded and pg_catalog
    is the last element in search_path, results in error message "invalid
    value for parameter 'search_path'" due to invalid list syntax. Thanks
    to Japin Li for the patch.

Version 4.2 - June 08 2025

This is a maintenance release to fix issues reported by users since latest
release and especially a search_path modification issue.

  - Preserve pg_catalog at end of search path if it is the case to allow
    pg_catalog overloaded function to be executed.
  - Add regression test on search_path forcing.
  - Preserve $user and other elements in search_path. Thanks to Japin Li
    for the patch.
  - Remove the LOAD command from documentation. Thanks to Li Jianping for the
    patch.
  - Fix session_preload_libraries documentation for non-superusers. Thanks
    to Japin Li for the patch.
  - Resolve a warning regarding incompatible pointer types. Thanks to Li
    Jianping for the patch.

Version 4.1 - March 18 2025

This is a maintenance release to fix issues reported by users since latest
release.

  - Use query instead of \d to list indexes in regression tests.
  - Fix wrong complain about temporary table created and active when a
    regular temporary table is created with (LIKE ... INCLUDING INDEXES).
    Thanks to Benjamin Wirth for the report.
  - Remove documentation for non-superuser configuration. Thanks to Julien
    Rouhaud for the patch.
  - Fix config in README. The concrete path to the shared library is not
    needed in postgresql.conf. Thanks to Simon Martin for the patch.
  - Install docs to a non-generic name, add a symlink to README.md that is
    referenced in DOCS. Thanks to Christoph Berg for the patch.
  - Add vaccum pg_class + pg_sleep(1) after each drop table in regression
    tests to wait that the temporary table is really removed.
  - Add missing PGDLLEXPORT tags on callback functions, those are needed on
    windows. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for the patch.

Version 4.0 - May 31 2024

This major release allow preloading pgtt in session_preload_libraries
and adds support to Windows operating system. Here is the complete list
of changes.

  - Add port to Windows operating system. Note that, for some unknown reasons
    it doesn't work at all with PostgreSQL 13. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for
    the patch
  - Allow preloading pgtt in session_preload_libraries. The module is now lazily
    loaded when it might be needed (after parse analysis, before executor
    startup and before utility statements execution), and all the code is simply
    bypassed if the underlying extension has not been created. Thanks to Julien
    Rouhaud for the patch.
  - Fix first query execution after a LOAD command. If the extension is loaded
    with a plain LOAD command, the search_path will only be set during the next
    query execution.  It means that the very first query executed after such a
    LOAD wouldn't see the global temporary tables. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for
    the patch.
  - Remove the relocation test, the extension is not relocatable anymore.
  - Fix crash with RESET ALL. RESET ALL has a NULL "name" field, so we can't use
    strcmp in that case.  Since the existing code is only interested in SET
    commands, just move up the check that the command is a VAR_SET_VALUE to
    ensure that we will have a GUC name. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for the patch.
  - Fix various minor whitespace and indent issues. Thanks to Julien Rouhaud for
    the patch.
  - Add Julen Rouhaud in the authors and maintainers list.

  - Use vacuum in test 08 to not look at pg_class too early before the temporary
    table is remove.
  - Fix setting default value of the parent table's persistence that can be

Works now on all PostgreSQL version from v9.5 to current. It also
fixes automatic creation of the underlying temporary table after a

Version 2.1 - May 11 2020

This is a maintenance release to complete the work on the extension

    allow it but just to mimic the behavior of Oracle and other RDBMS
    like DB2, SQL Server and MySQL for example.
  * Raise an error on an attempt to partition a Global Temporary Table.
    This is not supported, again not because PostgreSQL do not allow
    partition on temporary table but because other RDBMS like Oracle,
    DB2 and MySQL do not support it.

    when creating the GTT.

Other fixes:

  - Add regression tests on partitioning and FK.
  - Exclude regression.* files from git scope.
  - Improve documentation and add information about constraints.
