Version 2.1 - May 11 2020

This is a maintenance release to complete the work on the extension

    allow it but just to mimic the behavior of Oracle and other RDBMS
    like DB2, SQL Server and MySQL for example.
  * Raise an error on an attempt to partition a Global Temporary Table.
    This is not supported, again not because PostgreSQL do not allow
    partition on temporary table but because other RDBMS like Oracle,
    DB2 and MySQL do not support it.

    when creating the GTT.

Other fixes:
